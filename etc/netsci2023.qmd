<!-- Today i'll be talking about the interplay of adaptive behaviors and institutions in the study of contagions. The subtitle could have been "How to growing institutions on hyperedges"  -->

In contagion studies, we are interested in understanding the spread of an undesirable agent in a population.

When modeling this spread, we assume that the outcome of a contagion is determined by the rate at which individuals infect each other. As you get more infected people in your system, you end up with higher prevalence rate. 

This is how we model disease transmission, but also misinformation on social media and social contagion more generally.

But, when you think about it, we know the story isn't right. As contagions take off, relevant institutions will (hopefully) step in to try control the spread of the undesirable agent. 

This idea, that more of a bad thing forces institutions to do something about it, is the first aspect of traditional epidemiological modeling I want to revisit today.

A second point I want to make here is that to model institutions we don't need complex mechanisms.

Here what we learn in class. 

Classic models are simple. We assume a well-mixed population where agents become infected when bouncing off each other.

Complex models are agent-based. Once we are tired of taking people for molecules, you get into the agent-based module of the class. We feel powerful at modeling reality because we can include any detail we think that can influence a contagion. But the analysis part is tricky.

Both of these approaches lead to ask particular questions; for example how the structure of the network changes in the context of contagions. Think about how contact tracing was popular to understand and intervene during the COVID-19 pandemic. We wanted to trace the spread among individuals and how it was changing the network.

Instead of tweaking the network structure to see how individuals adapt to a contagion, we will keep the network as it is, and ask how changes in group norms and institutional policies can hinder contagion. Importantly, we  will assume that groups who seek local control of an epidemic draw from the successes and failures of other groups.

To give you an example, here are people at the beach. You might remember this guy showing up. This man dressed as reaper was protesting at the reopening of the beach in Florida at the peak of the pandemic. 

How are we to model what is happenning here. One option would be to simulate each person on this beach as agent on their own. Or we can simply see that two groups at work here, with different norms about the right behaviors to adopt during a contagion. 

In our model, we understand groups as collection of individuals who can put put in place norms and/or policies that can limit contagion, changin their fitness in doing so. Norms can be weak and informal, such as that man dressed as grim reaper warning beach-goers, or it can be the public health department imposing a mask mandate. These institutions will emerge and grow on hyperedges to locally affect the epidemic dynamics.

<!-- In our model, we understand groups as any gathering that impact the spread of contagion, or change the fitness of the gathering. Sharing norms, beliefs, or policies impact the fitness of the groups, so is inhabiting the same environments. Individuals sharing a bad ventilation systems will impact how they are gonna do during a contagion.  -->

In summary, intead of focusing on individual dynamics we'll assume that *groups* have dynamics.

## Questions:


 * what if institutions of varying strength can hinder contagions?

::: {.fragment}
 * what is the impact of timescales [and coupling between groups]{.strong-fade} on the co-evolution of contagions and institutions?
:::

![](figs/question.png){fig-align="center"}


::: {.notes}
With that in mind, we ask the following questions.

What if institutions try to reduce the spread of a contagion? Here this is really a question about the co-evolution of policy and collective dynamics.

[READ QUESTION 2]

Here I want to highlight on the importance of timescales for our approach. When I said that more of a bad things can be good, it really depends on the timescales at which institutions adapt to the epidemic. Fast and slow institutions have different impact on different epidemic scenarios.

:::

::: {.notes}
Here we show a single group of size 7 in 3 different states. When you move on the right, you get one more infected person in your group (as shown in red). This happens at a certain rate as indicated here. Note that this local infection rate, that is, the rate of infection within groups, is dependent on the institutional level of the group, ell. When you move on the left, people recover. 

Additionally, people can get infected across groups. Here, like bouncing balls in simpler models, people across groups can randomly bounce in someone in another group.

<!-- Possible contact with infected in other groups is given by the product of inter-group coupling $\rho$ and the expected number of infected units in a randomly selected group. (∑_{i,ℓ} i*G_{i,ℓ}) is the expected number of infected units in a randomly selected group. -->

::: {.notes}
What happens when groups invest in policies of varying strength.

Stronger institutions are better at reducing transmission. For example a public health department willing to enforce adopting the mask mandates is stronger than simply encouraging social distancing. 

This new dimension of institutional strength is represented by depth; groups having weak policies are the front and stroner policies are at the back.

Groups moves proportionally to the relative fitness of their current level, compared to one level up or down and the rate at which institutions copy each other.

<!-- Note that this group-level policy selection is basically a random walk in fitness space. We do not assume about group copying strategy anything fancy at the moment. We could though. -->

### Thinking, fast and slow

![](figs/regimes.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
Here we show how our model is able to reproduce a diversity of real-world scenarios.  

We will look at this 4x4 table showing the combination of fast institutions, or institutions that copy each other at a faster rate, relative to transmission rate, and known epidemic scenarios such as eradication and endemicity.

For each plot, i'll show how the proportion of people infected and institution strength changed in time. 
:::

## 

### Thinking, fast and slow

![](figs/regimesA.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
In this first case, the red curves show that fast institutions are able to contain a weak epidemic (as indicated by the red curves). The dotted line is the average prevalence rates across institutional level. The blue curves show that in this case only relatively weak institutions were necessary to contain the epidemic. In the steady states, we mostly have institutions of level 1 and 2.
:::

## 

### Thinking, fast and slow

![](figs/regimesB.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
The second plot is already more exciting. From now on, our beta rate will be fixed at the higher rate of .16. Slow institutions are able to control an emerging epidemic, but their relative slowness cause an initial large wave of cases. Note that the dampening is caused by policies taking some time to be effective, then once they work they are relaxed a little (never happened). Because institutions are slow, they do not remove their policies all at once, making them good at the eradication endgame.
:::

## 

### Thinking, fast and slow

![](figs/regimesC.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
Now we look at endemicity scenario, or when we accept to live with relatively high rate. The interplay of fast imitation and a stronger epidemic prevents strong institutions to emerge (compared to upper right plot). This worst case scenario means that the emerging epidemic becomes highly endemic. 
:::

##

### Thinking, fast and slow

![](figs/regimesD.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
Lastly, we have slow institutions in the context of endemicity. As before, here strong institutions temporarily control an existing outbreak before partially relaxing. But note how strong institutions keep exploring ways to save ressources, meaning that they will spent more time at low institutions in the limit. You have both that and institutions who do not want to pay the cost of instoring stronger policies. This lead to a situation where prevalence rate stay relatively high. 

- 99% of population at the lowest level
- $\rho$ = 0.5, max $\beta$

The steady-state of the run at the top becomes an instance on the bottom..
:::


::: {.notes}
But now we will focus on the steady state of our results. Both plots at the top become a single instance in the heatmaps at the bottom, where we have intergroup coupling on the yaxis (possible contact with infected in other groups), and transmission rate on the xaxis. Our plots can be found in the top right corner, where we have many potential infection coming from other groups together with strong epidemic. On the heatmap on the right, you see that we have an equilibrium prevalence rate of about 21%, and with the heatmap on the left, that around 42% of institutions are of level 2.
:::

##

### Institutional localization

![](figs/dashboard1c.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: { style="text-align: center;"}
Regions in parameter spaces come to be dominated by particular level of institutions..
:::

::: {.notes}
Here we can see that $\ell=1$  dominates the fitness landscape level with low $\beta$ and low $\rho$. The second level dominates in the regimes in between, while $\ell=3$ does best when we have strong $\beta$ and $\rho$. 

A phenomenon we observe is that certain level of institutionalization maintain the infection rate locally, but only some groups become self-sustaining.

In this regime, we find that increasing the transmission rates can increase the need for institutions more than it increases contagion. This ultimately results in lower prevalence steady states.

This is what this plot is showing. 

On the y-axis, we ask what happen if we remove the steady-state prevalence in a world where only institutions of a given leven exists from having a system where all institutions coexist (focus on the numerator in the expression at the bottom). 

Say that when you have only weaker institutions, you end up with a prevalence rate of 40%, but when you are surrounded with stronger institutions your prevalence goes down to 25%, then 25 - 40 gives a negative value. You benefit greatly from having stronger institutions without paying the associated cost of stronger institutions.

<!-- 
 * If $I\_ell > \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is higher when other people are doing at what you do.
 * If $I_\ell < \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is . When close to $-1$, institutions in the systems are helping you.
 * Free-riding is when lower institutions are doing better in presence of higher institutions, than by themselves. Inversely, higher level get screwed. Lower levels always exploit, higher levels always get exploited.

::: {.notes}
If weaker institutions free-ride, this means that stronger institutions are the suckers. This is what having a value of 1 means here. 

For $\ell=4$, it stays at $1$ because you don't have infection.

And we see this hierarchy of free-riding where stronger institution get exploited by weaker institutions, with middle ones exploiting the one above and being exploited by the one below.

The point of waiting is to reduce the lower levels, lower levels can observe fitness of $\ell+1$ and copy them. Free-riding is bad, there are groups who are not implementing strong institutions thereby letting the infection spread.

We need to find a regime where higher institutions are favored...to do that, the timescale at which each other copy each other needs to be slower. This brings us to the call for action...

## Food for thought

 * Rich dynamics emerge from group-based models without the need for complex mechanisms (but complicated math).
 * Slowing the imitation rate dynamics can be benefitial because it let weaker institutions to copy them.
 * But we can't engineer that. How can we get closer to that scenario? 
 * What do we say to policy makers?

Hi, i'll be presenting a quick demo of our visualization tool to investigate the clusters of similar sentences in complaints about airlines on tripadvisor to investigate patterns of language. 

In this scatter plot, each point represents a sentence. The cool thing here is that sentences that are closer together in space are also more semantically more similar. 

Example of topic 5 about delayed flights. Topic 5 is part of reduced topic 0. Then show how topic 40 and 23 are also related to the flights but in different ways. By looking at the more abstract representation of complaints about flights, we can start understanding patterns in language and cultures.

Today i'll talking about the interplay of adaptive behaviors and institutions in the study of contagions.

In contagion studies, we are interested in understanding the spread of an undesirable agents in a population.

When modeling this spread, we assume that the outcome of a contagion is determined by the rate at which individuals infect each other. As you get more infected people in your system, you end up with higher prevalence rate. 

This is how we model disease transmission, but also misinformation on social media and social contagion more generally.

But we know the story isn't right. As contagions take off, relevant institutions will (hopfully) step in to try control the spread of the undesirable agent. 

More of a bad thing forces institutions to do something about it.

A second aspect of traditional modeling I want to challenge today is that to model institutions we don't need complex mechanisms.

Here what we learn in class.

Classic models are simple. We assume a well-mixed population bouncing on each other, infecting when they get into contact.

Complex models are agent-based. Once you are tired of simple bouncing balls, you get into the agent-based module of the class. We feel powerful at modeling reality, including each relevant detail one might care about in a contagion. Then we get to the analysis part, we are at lost.

This naturally lead to studying how the structure of the network changes. As an example, contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic was the popular in many studies. We wanted to trace the spread among individuals and how it was changing the network.

Instead of tweaking the network structure to see how individuals adapt to a contagion, our idea was to start with group norms and see how they can hinder contagion.

In other words, we keep the network as it is. But we'll assume that *groups* have dynamics. 

Maybe some of you remember this photo of people at the beach at the peak of the pandemic. You might remember this guy showing up. How are we to understand what is happenning here. One option would be to model each agent on this beach on their own. Or we can simply see two groups here, with different norms about the right behaviors to adopt during a contagion. This is what I mean when I say that see the forest of groups before the tress of individuals

Even inhabiting the same environment can count to be part of a group. Groups sharing a bad ventilation or sewage systems will impact how they are gonna do during a contagion.

<!-- We want to know about the effect of humanly devised constraints that shape human interaction, as Alfred North would put it.  

Most behaviors only make sense in the light of social identity dynamics and a simply way to tackle this problem is to . -->

## Questions:

 * what happens if institutions of varying strength can hinder contagions?
 * what is the impact of timescales and coupling between groups on the co-evolution of contagions and institutions?

![](figs/question.png){fig-align="center"}


::: {.notes}
What if we let institutions of varying institutional strength try to reduce the spread of a contagion? Here this is really a question about the co-evolution of policy and collective dynamics.

[READ QUESTION 2]

Here I want to highlight on the importance of timescales for our approach. 

Fast and slow institutions can will have different impact on different epidemic scenarios. 

A related subquestion in our work was "how do we assess the effectiveness of institutions while they operate on longer time scale than our micro perspective". These questions draw their inspiration from the studies of institutional change and common-pool ressources. 

The intuition here is similar to that of how large firms produce more long-term, routined innovations while small firms capitalize on disruptive innovation. How does this idea translate when we add policy selection at group level.

:::

::: {.notes}
Lets start with a single group. 

In our model, we care about how many infected people are in your groups. Groups have a fixed size. Individuals can get infected at a rate beta and recover at a rate gamma. Groups can put in place norms and policies to limit contagion. 

We will represent that through an abstract institutional level $\ell$ which translate to a _local_ transmission rate $\beta(\ell) = \beta_0\ell^{-\alpha}$. Stronger $\ell$ means smaller rate.

Individuals are infected at a rate $\beta(\ell)$

The term at the bottom show show how we break down our systems into subsystems. 

Whereas $\beta_0 \ell^{-\alpha}$ is the internal rate of transmission, $R$ is the possible contact with infected in other groups. Assuming random mixing between groups, it is thes product of an inter-group coupling $\rho$ and the expected number of infected units in a randomly selected group. 

(∑_{i,ℓ} i*G_{i,ℓ}) is the expected number of infected units in a randomly selected group.

::: {.notes}
Stronger institutions are better at reducing transmission, but this require institutional effort and resources. 

To assess if the cost is worth it, groups copy each other based on perceived fitness $Z$. Groups move to various institutional strenght proportionally to the relative fitness of different levels. 

Institutional strength might be how willing a public health department is willing to invest in adopting the mask mandates, or whether a team of moderators want to enforce a code of conducts. Importantly, we are talking about institutions of similar size that adopt stronger policies. We are not comparing the federal public health departments with the city-level one.

Note that this group-level policy selection is basically a random walk in fitness space. We do not assume about group copying strategy anything fancy at the moment. We could though.

### Thinking fast and slow

![](figs/regimes.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}

In this first result, I want to show how our model is able to repdroduce a diversity of real-world scenarios.  

We will look at this 4x4 table showing the combination of fast institutions, or institutions that copy each other at a faster rate, relative to transmission rate, and known scenarios epidemic such as eradication and endemic.

For each plot, i'll show how prevalence and the proportion of each institutions change in time.

### Thinking fast and slow

For instance, this first plot show how fast institution are able to contain weak epidemic. Note that in this case, the only thing we need are relative weak institutions. In the steady states, we mostly have institutions of level 1 and 2.

##

### Thinking fast and slow

![](figs/regimesA2.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
In the second plot, we have a stronger epidemic with a slower copying rate. 
Strong institutions will eventually control an emerging epidemic after an initial large wave of cases, eventually leading to very low endemicity. 
:::

## 

### Thinking fast and slow

![](figs/regimesB.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

::: {.notes}
In the next row, we have the endemic scenario, or when we simply accept to live with a disease. Under fast imitation, strong but costly institutions can fail to emerge and an emerging epidemic becomes highly endemic. Think about Chlamydia, for instance.

### Thinking fast and slow

![](figs/regimesC.svg){fig-align="center" width=1200}

Lastly, we have slow institutions in endemic scenario. Comapred to the eradication scenario, here strong institutions temporarily control an existing outbreak before partially relaxing. This lead to a situation where we do not eradicate the disease.

:::

::: {.notes}
On the left plot, we can see the time evolution for one scenario where beta is .16, and intergroup coupling and copying rate are both high. Weak institutions are not up to the task, and the scenario is dominated by institution of level 2 and 3.

:::


::: {.notes}
The instance on the left is represented on the right as cell. I annotated the cell for level 2, which is at equilibrium at 42%. We can do the same 

A phenomenon we observe is that certain level of institutionalization is required to maintain the behaviour locally, but only some groups become self-sustaining. 

Here we can see that $\ell=1$  dominates the fitness landscape level with low $\beta$ and low $\rho$. The second level dominates in the regimes in between, while $\ell=3$ does best when we have strong $\beta$ and $\rho$. Main parameters $\beta = 0.16$; $\rho=0.1$; $\eta = 0.05$. Other parameters are fixed at $\eta=1$; $\alpha=1$; $\gamma=1$; $b=-1.0$; $c=1.05$; $\mu = 0.0001$.

 * Look at the numerator. 
 * If $I\_ell > \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is higher when other people are doing at what you do. For $\ell=4$, it stays at $1$ because you don't have infection.
 * If $I_\ell < \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is . When close to $-1$, institutions in the systems are helping you.
 * Free-riding is when lower institutions are doing better in presence of higher institutions, than by themselves. Inversely, higher level get screwed. Lower levels always exploit, higher levels always get exploited.
 * The point of waiting is to reduce the lower levels, lower levels can observe fitness of $\ell+1$ and copy them. Free-riding is bad, there are groups who are not implementing strong institutions thereby letting the infection spread.
 * We need to find a regime where higher institutions are favored...
 * to do that, the timescale at which each other copy each other needs to be slow...
 * This brings us to the call for action...

With this final result, we show how institutions can decide to not pay the cost to enforce stronger policies, benefiting from institutions who do, and we come back to how more of a bad things can actually help.

<!-- "Big learning curve for weaker institution". Copying more early on seems not to worth it because it takes time. 
* \eta gives characteristic time of copying. 1/\eta gives the characteristic scale for inst. to copy or not. Small eta means that groups have time to "flattened the curve", give it enough time 
* Fitness of higher inst can go up when small enough eta, giving time to other, weaker institutions to copy them.
* Slow institutions are “called upon” to intervene only in specific regimes of the transmission rate, whereas faster institutions tend to explore institutional actions on their own in all regimes.
* Slow institutions feel compelled to take action when coupled with sufficiently higher transmission rates that necessitate institutional responses -->

::: {.notes}
As with the last plot, we plot how the equilibrium prevalence at steady states changes as a function of transmission rate. In this first condition, we show what happens when we have relatively fast imitation rate. This is a typical result where  as you increase beta, you get a monotonic increase of prevalence rate.

Now, what if institutions of different institutional strenghts were by themselves? In other words, how would a world with only weak institutions would behave compared to the scenario when it can copy stronger institutions?

This is what this plot show. On the y axis, we have a normalized value that substract $\tilde{I}_{\ell}$, a world with only institutions of a given level, from the world we have seen so far in which we have policy selection.

 * What do we say to policy makers?

## Counter-intuitive claim: More spread can help 

* Think about the models you know. How often this is the case theat increasing transmission rate lead to lower equilibrium prevalence. 
* But we know this is happenning:
  * Disease A don't spread that much. We don't really care.
  * Disease B spread so we are, we'll do something about it. 
* Public health we'll intervene, or mods on subreddits for misinformation.

## Soapboax: higher-order networks are cool.

* During the pandemic, we like to think about how network structure change (tracing studies where people cut ties)
* But higher-order networks let us study how norms and institutions changes implemented at group-level (here perhaps workplace or city) impact our interactions.

## The Math

[\begin{equation} \label{eq:diffusion_me}
    \begin{split}
        \frac{d}{dt}G_{i,\ell}^{\textrm{epi}} &= \beta_0\ell^{-\alpha}\left[(i-1)+\mathbin{\color{blue}{R}}\right]\left(n-i+1\right)G_{i-1,\ell} \\
        &- \beta_0\ell^{-\alpha}\left(i+\mathbin{\color{blue}{R}}\right)\left(n-i\right)G_{i,\ell} \\
        &+ \gamma\left(i+1\right)G_{i+1,\ell} - \gamma i G_{i,\ell} \; . 
      
      \newline
      \newline
      
      \frac{d}{dt}G_{i,\ell}^{\textrm{sel}} &= \eta \left[G_{i,\ell-1}\left(Z_\ell Z_{\ell-1}^{-1} + \mu\right) + G_{i,\ell+1}\left(Z_\ell Z_{\ell+1}^{-1}+\mu\right) \right] \notag \\
                                              &- \eta \left(Z_{\ell - 1}Z_{\ell}^{-1}+Z_{\ell+1}Z_{\ell}^{-1} + 2\mu\right)G_{i,\ell}\; . 
    \newline
    \newline
    
    \end{split}

 * Look at the numerator. 
 * If $I\_ell > \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is higher when other people are doing at what you do. For $\ell=4$, it stays at $1$ because you don't have infection.
 * If $I\_ell < \tilde{I}_\ell$, your infection rate at equilibrium is . When close to $-1$, institutions in the systems are helping you.
 * Free-riding is when lower institutions are doing better in presence of higher institutions, than by themselves. Inversely, higher level get screwed. Lower levels always exploit, higher levels always get exploited.
 * The point of waiting is to reduce the lower levels, lower levels can observe fitness of $\ell+1$ and copy them. Free-riding is bad, there are groups who are not implementing strong institutions thereby letting the infection spread.
 * We need to find a regime where higher institutions are favored...
 * to do that, the timescale at which each other copy each other needs to be slow...
 * This brings us to the call for action...

## Stronger institutions being called upon

But what is a call for action? An impetus?!

"Big learning curve for weaker institution". Copying more early on seems not to worth it because it takes time.

* \eta gives characteristic time of copying. 1/\eta gives the characteristic scale for inst. to copy or not. Small eta means that groups have time to "flattened the curve", give it enough time 
* Fitness of higher inst can go up when small enough eta, giving time to other, weaker institutions to copy them.
* Slow institutions are “called upon” to intervene only in specific regimes of the transmission rate, whereas faster institutions tend to explore institutional actions on their own in all regimes.
* Slow institutions feel compelled to take action when coupled with sufficiently higher transmission rates that necessitate institutional responses
:::


## Food for thought

 * Slowing the imitation rate dynamics can be benefitial because it let weaker institutions to copy them.
 * But we can't engineer that. How can we get closer to that scenario? 
 * What do we say to policy makers?

Put arxiv. Make it pretty.
